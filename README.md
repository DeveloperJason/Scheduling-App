How to run the program:
Log in by entering the username and password into the fields on the first screen.
From the main menu, you can go to the Customer, Appointment, or Reports scenes.
The Customer scene displays a list of customers.  You can add a new customer or select one of the existing customers to update or delete.
The Appointment scene displays a list of appointments based on week or month.  You can view the next or previous month/week of appointments by clicking the Next and Previous buttons. You can also add a new appointment or select one of the existing appointments to update or delete.
In the Reports scene, you can select a report from the tabs at the top.  For Total Appointments, select the criteria from the choice boxes and click Run Report to display the results.  For Contact Schedules, selecting the contact from the choice box will populate the table view with that contact's appointments.  For Country Data, select the country from the choice box and click Run Report to see a appointment data for the select country.

The Country Data report was chosen so that users could easily see the total number of appointments and customers located in each country. This would allow the company to allocate more resources to the more popular locations.
